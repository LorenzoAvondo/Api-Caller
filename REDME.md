üöÄ API Caller
This project provides a simple, interactive web interface for making HTTP requests to various API endpoints, including support for JSON bodies and multiple file uploads (specifically PDF files). It's a handy tool for testing APIs directly from your browser.

‚ú® Features
Customizable API URL: Easily specify the target API endpoint.

Multiple HTTP Methods: Supports POST, GET, PUT, and DELETE requests.

JSON Request Body: Include a JSON payload for POST and PUT requests.

File Upload Support: Attach multiple PDF files to your requests.

Configurable File Field Name: Set the name of the form field for file uploads to match your API's expectations.

Dynamic File List: View and remove selected files before sending the request.

Response Display: See the API's response directly in the browser.

PDF Download: If the API responds with a PDF, it will automatically prompt you to download the file.

üõ†Ô∏è How to Use
Clone the repository:

Bash

git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME.git
cd YOUR_REPO_NAME
Open index.html: Simply open the index.html file in your web browser. There's no need for a local server, as it's a client-side application.

Configure your API Call:

API URL: Enter the complete URL of the API you want to interact with (e.g., https://api.example.com/data).

HTTP Method: Select the appropriate HTTP method from the dropdown (POST, GET, PUT, DELETE).

Request Body (JSON): If your request requires a JSON body, type or paste valid JSON into this textarea. This is optional and typically used for POST and PUT methods.

Nome campo file (File Field Name): If you are uploading files, ensure this field matches the name your backend API expects for file uploads (default is files).

File upload (PDF multipli): Click "Choose Files" to select one or more PDF documents. You can remove individual files from the list by clicking the "‚úñ" next to their names.

Call API: Click the "Call API" button.

View Results:

The API's response will be displayed in the Response Container.

If the API returns a PDF file, your browser will automatically start a download for download.pdf.
